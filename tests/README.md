  - This tests will read in a name from a file and then tell you the name that was in the file (My_Name).
    The program will then run again but all output will be going into a file. this means you will need to 
    input a name without a prompt, the contents of the file will then be cat to stdout.
  - This tests requires name.c is compiled to a.out before running.
